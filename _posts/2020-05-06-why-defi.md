An experiment in writing 100 words a day:

"DeFi" -- or decentralized finance -- is an emerging area of cryptocurrency applications. These applications 
implement concepts from traditional finance like lending, derivatives and insurance on the public ledgers
available to anyone with an internet connection. We expect to see these new iterations offering varied 
products and services to a growing user base at better terms and rates than seen on the market today. 
This expectation is driven in large part by the unique position these applications find themselves in 
to leverage the underlying blockchain technology they are built on top of. The decentralized nature of 
these budding financial platforms ensures equal access to services and that opening an account is as simple 
as downloading an app. By transacting only in digital assets, DeFi products should be able to cut costs 
and remove unnecessary intermediaries while directly passing the savings on to the end user. And the fact 
that these applications are mostly built with composable software allows for a combinatorial explosion 
in applications that permits bewildering opportunities for experimentation in new financial instruments 
beyond those we have seen to date.
