Programmable money, like the digital assets found on "smart contract platforms", is a ["zero to one" innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One). It turns out that attaching automatic logic to digitized value results in use cases that would not be feasible in traditional finance. We see an early example with **flash loans**. In a flash loan, I can take out an arbitrarily-sized loan (subject to current liquidity) for essentially free _as long as I pay back the loan by the end of the transaction_. This means I have free/cheap leverage to enhance the returns on my existing capital. The way this works is that if I fail to pay back the loan (e.g. because my stack of trades did not pan out) the entire transaction fails and I only end up paying a nominal transaction fee, rather than the entire cost of capital I'd incur for a regular loan. This type of loan would be very hard to create in a traditional setting as it would require undoing all of the intermediate trades if I couldn't find a productive use of the funds -- honestly, next to impossible.
